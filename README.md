## 📌 Overview

**Saheb Paper Pvt. Ltd.** (Chandisar, Palanpur, Gujarat) is a state-of-the-art paper manufacturing facility. This ERP platform digitizes and unifies the entire plant lifecycle—transitioning shop floor operations from paper logbooks to real-time, touch-optimized, multi-role digital control.

From raw material weighbridge inwards to pulper recipe chemistry, paper machine parent rolls, rewinder slitting, QR traceability, QC lab tear/burst certificates, utilities (boiler, ETP, grid power), finished goods inventory, and dispatch delivery challans with gate passes.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights & Capabilities

- **100% QR Traceability**: Complete lineage tracing from raw material lots → pulper batch recipe → machine jumbo rolls → rewound slitted reels → dispatch delivery challan.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 6 distinct operational roles with custom accessible modules, auto-redirect routing, worker login simulation for admins, and read-only viewer mode.
- **Hardware & Printer Integration**: Built-in thermal barcode/QR sticker designer with ESC/POS & TSC/Zebra presets (4"×3", 3"×2", 2"×2") and multi-page A4 delivery challan printing.
- **Offline-Resilient Local Persistence**: Zero-latency local caching with reactive state syncing, automatic schema migrations, and cloud-ready data model.
- **Multilingual Support**: Real-time localization in **English**, **Hindi (हिन्दी)**, and **Gujarati (ગુજરાતી)**.
- **Utilities Telemetry**: Shift-by-shift logging for boiler steam pressure/fuel efficiency, ETP effluent chemical parameters, and electricity power factor/kVA demand.
